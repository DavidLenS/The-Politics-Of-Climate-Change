    "text": "Course Requirements\nParticipation:\nAttending the weekly sessions and reading assigned articles (mandatory) before class. Use Perusall to annotate articles collaboratively and exchange via Slack. (Of course, there is still also the discussion forum on ILIAS to post questions or discuss with your peers if you are stuck.) You are encouraged to also have a look at the further readings.\nDiscussion questions for mandatory readings (Pass/Fail):\nEach week, students should submit a discussion question for at least one mandatory reading (via Perusall or ILIAS) at the latest on the day of the seminar until 12:00 (noon). This can just be one sentence. E.g., a comment that points something you liked about the paper and/or something that you would have done differently. You can also relate your discussion question to current events.\nPresentation of one paper (Pass/Fail):\nThere will be short group presentations (max. 12 minutes, 3-4 people depending on the seminar size, support presentation with slides) of selected research articles beginning after the Easter break. You should be able to convey the main take-aways and core results of empirical research. But more on this during the semester!\nSubmission of a research proposal (Optional):\nYou have the possibility to write a research proposal developing your research question for your final term paper during the semester. It a) gives the motivation for your research question and, b) presents a short (preliminary) overview of related literature, which can already lead to hypotheses. Your term paper can be based on your proposal but does not have to. Length: 700 – 800 words (excluding references, +/- 10% , 12pt font - Times New Roman or Calibri, and 1.5 line spacing), it can be written in English or German. The proposal should be submitted as PDF via ILIAS. Deadline: April 18, 2023, 20:00. You will get detailed feedback from me. Furthermore, by opting in for the research proposal you agree to give feedback on two proposals of your peers.\nTerm paper (100% of your grade):\nYou will write a short term paper on the topics discussed in the seminar. You should a) identify a research question on your own, b) develop a theory (causal mechanism) and hypotheses, c) describe data and method used to answer your research question, and d) the paper should include a (preliminary/basic) empirical analysis (descriptives, correlations, basic regressions. If you want, you can also include ideas for more advanced analyses. Especially, if you choose not to write a research proposal, I recommend you to come to my office hours to discuss your topic. We will discuss in more detail on how to write a “good” term paper during the semester. The paper has to be submitted as PDF via ILIAS. The length should be around 3500 words (excluding references, +/- 10% , 12pt font - Times New Roman or Calibri, and 1.5 line spacing), can be written in English or German. Late submissions will result in deductions of 1/3 of a grade point per day. In case of any questions or problems, please get in touch with me early. More on this to come during the semester. Deadline: July 4, 2023, 20:00."

Environmental Research Letters, 14(11).\n\nFurthermore, there are mandatory readings for each session. They convey the session’s the take-away message. Therefore, you should read these texts carefully. We will use Perusall as a tool for collaborative reading. You will find the mandatory readings on ILIAS However, they (mostly) should be accessible via the university library (Katalog-Primo)."

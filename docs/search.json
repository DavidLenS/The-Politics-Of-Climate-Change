    "text": "The Politics of Climate Change\nClimate change is one of this century’s most significant challenges. Climate change mitigation and adaptation will require massive economic transformations and strongly affect other fields: infrastructure, health, agriculture, biodiversity, migration, and many more. How do political actors – parties, politicians, social movements, institutions, international organizations, etc. – react to and influence these transformations? And what about public opinion? Do citizens change their behavior (voting, consumption, etc.)? If yes, why and under what conditions?\nThis course introduces students to theories and methods on the nexus of climate change and politics. It aims to equip the students with the necessary skills to formulate and pursue their own research questions at the intersection of climate change and politics. In addition, students will learn to engage critically with existing research and understand its implications. In doing so, the course will primarily focus on (quantitative) empirical research addressing party competition, political behavior, and policymaking."

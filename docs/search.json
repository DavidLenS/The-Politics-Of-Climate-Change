    "text": "Spring 2023\n\n\n\nClimate change is one of this century’s most significant challenges. Climate change mitigation and adaptation will require massive economic transformations and strongly affect other fields: infrastructure, health, agriculture, biodiversity, migration, and many more. How do political actors – parties, politicians, social movements, institutions, international organizations, etc. – react to and influence these transformations? And what about public opinion? Do citizens change their behavior (voting, consumption, etc.)? If yes, why and under what conditions? This course introduces students to theories and methods on the nexus of climate change and politics. It aims to equip the students with the necessary skills to formulate and pursue their own research questions at the intersection of climate change and politics. In addition, students will learn to engage critically with existing research and understand its implications. In doing so, the course will primarily focus on (quantitative) empirical research addressing party competition, political behavior, and policymaking.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing concepts, definitions, and measurements in the field of climate change in political science research\nGetting to know the recent literature and being able to critically engage with it\nBeing able to interpret the results of the analyses applied in the literature\nBeing able to present the core results and main take-aways of research articles - Identifying research questions and research designs at the intersection of climate change and politics\nFormulating own research questions and conducting own research\n\n\n\n\nParticipation:\nAttending the weekly sessions and reading assigned articles (mandatory) before class. Use Perusall to annotate articles collaboratively and exchange via Slack. (Of course, there is still also the discussion forum on ILIAS to post questions or discuss with your peers if you are stuck.) You are encouraged to also have a look at the further readings.\nDiscussion questions for mandatory readings (Pass/Fail):\nEach week, students should submit a discussion question for at least one mandatory reading (via Perusall or ILIAS) at the latest on the day of the seminar until 12:00 (noon). This can just be one sentence. E.g., a comment that points something you liked about the paper and/or something that you would have done differently. You can also relate your discussion question to current events.\nPresentation of one paper (Pass/Fail):\nThere will be short group presentations (max. 12 minutes, 3-4 people depending on the seminar size, support presentation with slides) of selected research articles beginning after the Easter break. You should be able to convey the main take-aways and core results of empirical research. But more on this during the semester!\nSubmission of a research proposal (Optional):\nYou have the possibility to write a research proposal developing your research question for your final term paper during the semester. It a) gives the motivation for your research question and, b) presents a short (preliminary) overview of related literature, which can already lead to hypotheses. Your term paper can be based on your proposal but does not have to. Length: 700 – 800 words (excluding references, +/- 10% , 12pt font - Times New Roman or Calibri, and 1.5 line spacing), it can be written in English or German. The proposal should be submitted as PDF via ILIAS. Deadline: April 18, 2023, 20:00. You will get detailed feedback from me. Furthermore, by opting in for the research proposal you agree to give feedback on two proposals of your peers.\nTerm paper (100% of your grade):\nYou will write a short term paper on the topics discussed in the seminar. You should a) identify a research question on your own, b) develop a theory (causal mechanism) and hypotheses, c) describe data and method used to answer your research question, and d) the paper should include a (preliminary/basic) empirical analysis (descriptives, correlations, basic regressions. If you want, you can also include ideas for more advanced analyses. Especially, if you choose not to write a research proposal, I recommend you to come to my office hours to discuss your topic. We will discuss in more detail on how to write a “good” term paper during the semester. The paper has to be submitted as PDF via ILIAS. The length should be around 3500 words (excluding references, +/- 10% , 12pt font - Times New Roman or Calibri, and 1.5 line spacing), can be written in English or German. Late submissions will result in deductions of 1/3 of a grade point per day. In case of any questions or problems, please get in touch with me early. More on this to come during the semester. Deadline: July 4, 2023, 20:00.\n\n\n\nHelpful background readings for this seminar include the following articles:\n\nBernauer, T. (2013). Climate change politics. Annual review of political science, 16, 421-448.\nCao, X., Milner, H. V., Prakash, A., & Ward, H. (2014). Research frontiers in comparative and international environmental politics: an introduction. Comparative Political Studies, 47(3), 291-308.\nHowe, P. D., Marlon, J. R., Mildenberger, M., & Shield, B. S. (2019). How will climate change shape climate opinion?. Environmental Research Letters, 14(11).\n\nFurthermore, there are mandatory readings for each session. They convey the session’s the take-away message. Therefore, you should read these texts carefully. We will use Perusall as a tool for collaborative reading. You will find the mandatory readings on ILIAS However, they (mostly) should be accessible via the university library (Katalog-Primo).\n\n\n\nCourse website, Slack, and ILIAS:\nThe plan is to use primarily the course website and Slack for providing the structure of the seminar and communication, respectively. Nevertheless, you will find the information on ILIAS as well. Make sure to regularly check your university e-mail address.\n\nYou can find the course website here: https://politics-of-climate-change.netlify.app\nThe ILIAS seminar name is: PS Einführung in die Vergleichende Regierungslehre: The Politics of Climate Change [PS] [1. PG] (FSS 2023). Ensure that you have access to the system and that e-mails sent over ILIAS are forwarded to the e-mail account you check regularly.\nIf you have contacted me with a question via any channel and you did not hear back after 2 days (except over the weekend), please just send me your question again!\n\nOffice hours:\nIn-person (A 340) or via Zoom, Tue, 10:15 – 11:45, please make an appointment by e-mail. - If you have a specific question or problem (e.g., finding a research question), please tell me before coming to the office hours (when making the appointment). This way , I can also prepare for it making it more productive and constructive.\nCovid-19 (and general illness):\nIf you feel ill or have symptoms, please be considerate of your fellow students and yourself(!). Just let me know by e-mail.\nStudents with disabilities or chronic illnesses:\nPlease contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses.\nAnd please do this early in the semester so that we can make the appropriate arrangements immediately. If you need support:\nOf course, you can always talk directly to me if you feel comfortable with the question. It is important to note that the University’s Equality and Diversity Office supports and advises you in cases of discrimination or sexual harassment. The responsible contact person in such a case is Dipl.-Psych. Ute Pfründer. She is trained to deal with such incidents and will keep everything strictly confidential. No action will be taken without your express consent. Further counseling services offered by the university can be found via this link.\n\n\n\nThe reading list will be updated from time to time. Keep an eye on announcements on Slack or ILIAS.\n\n\n\nIntro Session (February 14)\n\nNo mandatory reading\nSeminar outline\n\n\n\n\nThe Science of Climate Change & Impacts (February 21)\n\nMandatory Readings:\n\nCarleton, T.
